# Dooz/Tic-Tac-Tao

Dooz or Tic-Tac-Tao is a simple pen-and-paper game. I created this implementation using Kotlin and
Jetpack Compose for Android devices.

## Features

### Technical

- Jetpack Compose
- Material3 and Dynamic Color

### Game

- Variable game board grid size from three-by-three to nine-by-nine (Larger than nine-by-nine is
  simply ridiculous and unplayable in mobile phones)
- Variable game ai difficulty (easy, medium, hard)

### Variations

#### Simple Game

The Simple game is the most simple variation of Tic-tac-tao with a three-by-three grid with two
players. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal is the winner.

##### Simple Game AI

Currently, in hard mode, AI uses a strategy rather than an AI search algorithm like MinMax. This
strategy consists of these steps: Win, Block, Fork, Block Fork, Center Play, Corner Play, and Side
Play.

Strategy's source: Flexible Strategy Use in Young Children's Tic-Tac-Toe by Kevin Crowley, Robert S.
Siegler

[More info on the strategy here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15516709cog1704_3)

In Easy difficulty, AI plays a random empty cell in the grid. In Medium difficulty, AI chooses
between Easy difficulty and Hard difficulty for each move based on a 50/50 chance.
